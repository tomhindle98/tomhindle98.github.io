<p>Web standards have been introduced to ensure that more websites will function efficiently and effectively, instead of them all using their own different standards. This means that everyone will look at the same list of “rules” per say, meaning they can build websites that will be flexible and used on all the various platforms of media that are available today. Making them inter-operable is also essential, this just means that the website can be used on different web browsers, rather than just google chrome for example. The standards have also been introduced to make the actual development of these websites faster, as more experienced web creators can find the best solution to the feature they are trying to implement into the website that they are creating. One body that helps to create and inform people about these standards is w3.org, which is a website where you can read about the different standards that are being implemented into today’s websites. </p>
<p>Using current standards is a good idea when developing your own website, as it can allow for easy troubleshooting when an error occurs, and means you will be able to continue maintaining the website in the future when new standards are introduced as you are already up to date with the current ones, meaning only slight additions will have to be made. All current specifications are also compatible with previous versions, which will come in very handy when dealing with older browsers and devices. However, there are so many standards around now that following them strictly would end up anchoring you down and taking the development, as you would have to read through all the standards and making sure your website fits them all, which would be a challenge. Not all browsers support the current standards, which is why some features on websites are only available on certain browsers. This means that website creators have to go through testing their site on different websites to see which standards are supported and which aren’t, or alternatively they have to learn these limitations, which would be quite time consuming.</p>
<p>Throughout my site’s development, I was still learning about new techniques and features through the weekly lectures and workshops. To ensure my site was as effective as it could be, I incorporated the new things I was learning into my website, such as using jQuery instead of JavaScript. At first, I didn’t want to change to jQuery as I’d just started to understand JavaScript, but I soon realised that jQuery was much more efficient, so I switched over to that language for all my JavaScript needs. I used media queries to ensure that my site was responsive, meaning that it could be used easily on different sized screens, such as tablets and mobile phones.</p>
<p>For my website, I would say my biggest weakness was the JavaScript and jQuery aspects of it the most challenging. I found these quite hard to get my head around at first, but through more practise and reading about them, I managed to get my head around them more. However, I still found them quite challenging to implement into my website, but I soon started to play around with it, such as adding the colour and width inputs onto my customizer page, which used jQuery to function properly, which I was quite proud of when I finally got them working. My biggest strength was probably the CSS part, as I had used this before I was already fairly confident with it, so I could implement it quite easily to customise the appearance of my website, making it aesthetically pleasing, adding different colours when hovering and changing opacity of an element.</p>
